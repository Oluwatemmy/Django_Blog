## Description

This repository contains a Django-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) blog application that I built during a course. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

- View a list of existing blog posts with titles and summaries.
- Read the full content of individual blog posts.
- Update and edit existing blog posts.
- Delete unwanted or outdated blog posts.

## Technologies Used

- Django framework for backend development.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
- SQLite database for storing blog post data.
- RESTful API design principles for efficient data manipulation.

2. Ensure you have Python and Django installed on your system.
3. Set up the Django database by running `python manage.py migrate`.
4. Run the development server using `python manage.py runserver`.
